The `glosmathtools` package can be used to generate a mathematical

on the `glossaries` package. 

The main features are:
- symbol categories (e.g.: latin, greek)
- automatic but customizable symbol sorting
- easy subscript management
- easy accentuation managment
- abbreviation support (with first use definition)
- bilangual nomenclatures (for bilangual documents)
- bilangual abbreviations

At the time being, the documentation is based on `ulthese` class and
in french only.
